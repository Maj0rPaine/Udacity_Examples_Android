        aquarium or river, or a lake, and definitely the ocean. \nFun fact is that I have several aquariums and also a
        river. \n\nI like eating fish, too. Raw fish. Grilled fish. Smoked fish. Poached fish - not so much. \nAnd
        sometimes I even go fishing.\n\nI love fish. \n\nThe kind that is alive and swims around in an
